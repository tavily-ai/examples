    "This code defines a workflow for conducting research on a company, gathering information from various sources (using Tavily), and generating a detailed report. It starts by setting up a `ResearchState` data structure, which holds the company's name, documents retrieved during research, and messages exchanged during the process. The `Citation` and `QuotedAnswer` classes define how citations and answers should be structured when generating the report.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `TavilyQuery` and `TavilySearchInput` classes allow for multi-query searches using the Tavily search tool, enabling more precise and efficient information gathering. The `tavily_search` function is an asynchronous tool that performs these searches in parallel, collecting and consolidating the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow involves several key functions. `tool_node` handles the execution of search tools and saves the results for later processing. The `call_model` function invokes the research model to gather relevant information about the company, based on the most recent weekâ€™s developments. The `should_continue` function decides whether to continue using research tools or to proceed with writing the report. Finally, the `write_report` function generates a detailed report based on the retrieved documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow is managed by a `StateGraph`, which orchestrates the sequence of operations, deciding which node (research, tools, or report writing) to execute next based on the current state. This setup enables a structured and systematic approach to researching a company and producing a well-informed report."
