    "This code defines a workflow for conducting research on a company, gathering information from various sources (using **Tavily**), and generating a detailed report. It starts by setting up a `ResearchState` data structure, which holds the company's name, keywords, documents retrieved during research, and messages exchanged during the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Citation` and `QuotedAnswer` classes define how citations and answers should be structured when generating the report, ensuring clear and accurate referencing of sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `TavilyQuery` and `TavilySearchInput` classes allow for multi-query searches using the **Tavily Search** tool, enabling more precise and efficient information gathering. The `tavily_search` function is an asynchronous tool that performs these searches in parallel, collecting and consolidating the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `TavilyExtractInput` class defines the input structure for extracting raw content from URLs using **Tavily Extract**, allowing for more detailed information gathering when needed. This is especially useful in situations where summaries alone are insufficient, and deeper content extraction is required, such as in the case of detailed company research.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow is managed by a `StateGraph`, which orchestrates the sequence of operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The workflow starts at the `research` node to initiate the research process.\n",
    "- Based on `should_continue`, it either continuing researching with *Tavily Search* or moves to curating the gathered documents using Tavily Extract (`curate` node).\n",
    "- After curating, the workflow continues to `write`, where a detailed report with citations is written.\n",
    "- Finally, `publish` converts the report into a PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow involves several key functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `tool_node` handles the execution of search tools and stores the results for further processing. It ensures that only new documents are added to the `documents` dictionary, summarizing the findings in a message.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- `research_model` invokes the research model to gather relevant information about the company, based on recent developments in the past week. It uses the `tavily_search` tool to gather documents and provides specific instructions for focusing on the company's keywords. It also determines the next course of action in the workflow. Depending on the information gathered so far, the model decides whether to continue executing the **Tavily Search** tool to gather more data or to proceed to the next step. This decision-making capability is what makes the workflow agentic, allowing it to dynamically adapt to the specific research needs and ensure that the most relevant and comprehensive information is included in the final output.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `should_continue` determines whether to continue using research tools or proceed to curating the gathered information based on the model's decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `select_and_process` curates the gathered documents to retain those most relevant to the company. It generates a prompt for a model to filter the documents, excluding those with conflicting information or irrelevant keywords. The relevant documents are stored in `RAG_docs`, and additional raw content is extracted.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `write_report` generates a detailed, in-depth report based on the curated documents (`RAG_docs`). The report is written in Markdown syntax, and includes a citation section with sources formatted as hyperlinks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `generete_pdf` converts the generated report into a PDF file and saves it to a designated directory for easy sharing and reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup enables an agentic approach to company research, resulting in a well-informed, well-cited report. By utilizing a multi-query strategy, document filtering, and additional extraction from selected documents, the workflow ensures efficient and accurate data processing."
